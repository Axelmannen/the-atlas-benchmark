# The Atlas Benchmark

Tha Atlas Benchmark offers a collection of scripts and functions for evaluating 2D trajectory predictors.

Atlas allows automated systematic evaluation and comparison of the built-in, external and new prediction methods on several popular datasets (ETH, ATC and THÃ–R) using probabilistic and geometric accuracy metrics (ADE, FDE, k-ADE and FDE, NLP).

Important highlights of Atlas include:

1. Supported import of new datasets (labeled detection streams),

2. Support for contextual cues in the environment,

3. Automated calibration of prediction hyperparameters,

4. Automated parametrized scenario extraction, 

5. Direct interface to the prediction methods.

# Installation and setup
Get all the submodules first:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Please make sure to download the models for S-GAN. Once you cd in the folder sgan, run the following script: 

```
bash scripts/download_models.sh
```

Make sure to install atlas in your local virtual environmnet:

```
python3 -m venv atlas-env
```

or we recommend to use conda

```
conda create -n atlas-env python=3.7
```

Afterwards you can run pip to install the requirements (you may need to install swig via apt)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can verify the installation by running tests/unittests.py`.

# How to use it

The functionality of Atlas is fully described and illustrated in [docs/tutorial.md](docs/tutorial.md)

For a quick intro, head over to the `demo/` folder and check out the tutorial notebooks:
